; - shift ... The displacement with respect to the origin. 
; - size ... 3D vector defining width,height and depth of the volume of interest. Choose this value with respect to the size and amount of the generated objects. Setting this value to the uselessly high values may consume nearly all of the physical memory of the computer.
